# Data-manipulation-and-visualization-of-gene-expression-data-from-NCBI-GEO

A simple approach to transform NCBI GEO datasets into a format that facilitates data visualization and pattern recognition is shown here.
The data manipulation tasks such as reshaping, grouping, and computing summary statistics are carried out using R packages. The resulting data is saved in .csv format and then visualized using Python's seaborn package.

A sample dataset is obtained from NCBS-GEO:

(inspired by a YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RukuTtiY4Sg) that demonstrated data visualization techniques in R)
